## Hi, I'm Lanie Molinar Carmelo 👋

I'm a totally blind, autistic, chronically ill Christian woman and screen reader user, currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at Colorado Christian University Online. I’m passionate about accessibility, self-hosting, and using tech to empower others.

### 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Computer Science fundamentals (Freshman year)
- Braille proofreading through the National Federation of the Blind
- LaTeX for accessible academic writing
- Emacspeak and advanced screen reader workflows

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack

- **Daily Driver**: Windows 11 mini PC with WSL (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
- **Self-Hosting**: Raspberry Pi 500 running Stormux (Arch Linux ARM)
- **Services I Host**: Authentik, Caddy, HomeAssistant, Joplin Server, Mealie, Uptime Kuma, and more
- **Tools I Use**: VSCode, Overleaf, Cockpit, Tailscale, SendGrid (migrating to Microsoft 365 SMTP)
- **Web Projects**:
  - [laniecarmelo.tech](https://laniecarmelo.tech) – my personal site
  - [iamhouse.org](https://iamhouse.org) – a nonprofit project I help manage

### 💡 Why I Self-Host

I don’t self-host for privacy, but to save money and because I love experimenting with tech. It’s a hands-on way to learn and build resilience in managing real-world systems.

### 📱 Devices I Use

- Pixel 9 Pro (main phone)
- iPhone 13 Mini (backup)
- Pixel Tablet
- Brailliant BI 40X Braille display

### 🙏 Faith & Values

My Christian faith is central to who I am. I strive to reflect that in how I learn, build, and serve others through technology.
